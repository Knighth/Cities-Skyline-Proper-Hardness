Proper Hardness

Just a fork of the original, peeps are saying it needs updating for use with post AD patches, they are right.
Oringal author is apparently busy with his own full game now, cool.
I'm just at the stage of playing around with this for sh1ts and giggles to see what
really 'must' be updated just to function under post AD patches. 
No plans for actual enhancements, more of just maybe helping other people to get started in updating it.
ie.. get it 'functional' as is, then someone else can take over changing\adding too it etc.

Nothing local i'm screwing with is pushed back to this fork yet. 10/23/2015
